      <strong style="font-size: 27px;">The Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Explorer Edition - HOW?</strong>
      <br>
      You may think of Xiaomi (or not - no-one's heard of them) as the brand who sell their products at high quality but very cheap. This might be the BEST example of this. For only £300, you get 210W charging, <strong>which charges from 0% to 100% in 10mins</strong>, a solid chipset, great 200mp cameras and to top it off, a large fanbase and extremely good software - for example, in software - there's no difference between a £100 Xiaomi phone and a £1500 Xiaomi phone!

      <strong style="font-size: 27px;">The Google Pixel 7 - A superphone for £599</strong>
      <br>
      Think about Apple, who's software is built from the ground up to suit the smartphones, and so it cannot compare to a brand like Samsung, who use another brand's software for their devices. Of course, we are talking about Google here, the company that made Android, and the only one that can suck all of the Android goodness into one phone. That's where the Pixels come in. In 2021, they released the heroic Google Pixel 6, which had an Android experience which really connected to the phone. But now, in 2022, they are proud to announce the Google Pixel 7. It has the latest technology, combined with the feel of the old phone. It is quite literally superb.<br><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_7-11903.php">Related: Google Pixel 7 Specsheet</a>

      <strong style="font-size: 27px;">The Meta Quest Pro - The Good, The Bad, The Expensive</strong>
      <br>
      According to Mark Zuckerberg in Meta Connect 2022, the Meta Quest Pro has officially launched with a starting price of $1900. It has been declared that this is unfortunately only a headset meant for work, not play. But blockbuster games (like Beat Saber and Population: One) work fine, but if you want a cool Meta VR headset to play games on, then the Quest 2 is still your best option. The Quest Pro has enhanced multitasking and a color camera, however. At the time this article was written, you can pre-order the headset now.
