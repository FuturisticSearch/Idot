      This site was developed by JamesMarke, PythonScratcher, EXTRAEPICSTUFF and crystalyser562. Mostly,
            the HTML was by EXTRAEPICSTUFF, CSS by<br>JamesMarke, and PythonScratcher and crystalyser562 contributed to a lot of things.
            And we all have our little projects in our own webpages!
